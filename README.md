# Armstrong Number Program (C)

## 📌 Project Details
This project is developed as part of my **End Semester C Programming Project**.  
The program checks whether a given number is an **Armstrong Number** using the C programming language.

An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the total number of digits.

Example:  
153 → 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153
